Have pound of turkey, can of pinapple tidbits, can of tomato
paste, taco powder, rice.

Figure out how much time you need to prepare rice so that it's done
when the turkey is done... turkey takes about 15 mins

1) Put turkey in fry pan (with little olive oil), put taco
   powder in and brown the turkey.
2) Put tomato paste/pinapple into pot and simmer (while you're
   browning turkey).
3) When turkey is completely browned drain tomato/pinapple of excess
   fluid and put it into pan.
4) Place cooked rice into pan also and mix all together
